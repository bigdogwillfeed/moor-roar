Ha.  More like MOAR ROAR, amirite?

Grabs a bunch of known, public projects from the Glitch API and shows you random ones. Channel surfing, but cooler.

Interested in:
 - faving projects
 - persisting at least the faves (so there's something to surf quickly)
 - ignoring exact dupes
 - add hashes to the ignore list
 - load moar when no more loading and we've wrap around (instead of after 50 clicks)
 - something that makes initial surfing more fun, without hammering projects
